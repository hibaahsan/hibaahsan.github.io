I am a PhD student at the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University, advised by <a href="https://www.silvioamir.com/">Silvio Amir</a> and <a href="https://www.byronwallace.com/">Byron Wallace</a>. I work in the clinical natural language processing domain. My research looks into extracting information from patient notes with minimal supervision.

I graduated with a Masters in Computer Science from UMass Amherst in 2023. Prior to Masters, I was a Research Engineer in the Advertising team at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/msidc/default.aspx">Microsoft IDC</a> where I worked on improving the relevance of sponsored search results. I hold a Bachelors in Information Technology from the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, India.
